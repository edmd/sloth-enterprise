- Fun way to use interfaces! Inheritance should be used, with object specific logic and properties within each type
- Each child or adapter class can wrap or abstract out the external service
- Define interfaces for the common methods in the child classes
- We can now use dependency injection on the correct interfaces to make the code easier to test
- Tests can be divided into unit and integration tests
